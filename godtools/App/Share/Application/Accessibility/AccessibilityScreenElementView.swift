// NOTE: Place within a view that makes up a screen.  Typically a GeometryReader or VStack etc.
// Having accessibilityIdentifier on the top level GeometryReader was somehow causing an issue when querying for the choose app language button in OnboardingTutorialView.
// Also keeping the accessibility on a TextElement solved issues with querying.  Tried placing on a Group and ZStack but was unable to find the element. ~Levi
