Looking for an easy way to share with others how to know Jesus Christ?  

- Works offline in 50+ languages
- Provides resources for follow up and growth

This multilingual app equips you to be able to easily and clearly share your faith. When God gives you opportunities for spiritual conversations we want you to feel prepared and confident as you reach out to others.

God Tools includes the tried and true presentations of these messages:

1. The Four Spiritual Laws

2. Knowing God Personally

3. Satisfied?

The first two booklets simply explain the gospel message, while "Satisfied?" helps Christians understand what it means to walk in the power of the Holy Spirit.

God Tools also contains compelling articles on a variety of topics from EveryStudent.com, a popular website for people seeking answers to their questions about life and God.

As you share the good news, remember the definition of successful evangelism. "Taking the initiative to share Jesus Christ in the power of the Holy Spirit and leaving the results to God." We hope this app blesses you and many others as you step out in faith to help others grow to love and follow Him.
