An easy way to share your faith so that others can know Jesus Christ

- Works offline in 60+ languages
- Provides resources for follow up and growth

This multilingual app equips you to be able to easily and clearly share your faith with visually engaging presentations. When God gives you opportunities for spiritual conversations we want you to feel prepared and confident as you reach out to others.

GodTools includes the tried and true presentations of these messages:

1. Knowing God Personally

2. The Four Spiritual Laws

3. Would you like to know God personally? 

4. Satisfied?

The first three simply explain the gospel message, while "Satisfied?" helps Christians understand and enjoy the presence of God's Holy Spirit in their lives.

As you share the gospel, remember the definition of successful evangelism. "Taking the initiative to share Jesus Christ in the power of the Holy Spirit and leaving the results to God." We hope this app blesses you and many others as you step out in faith to help others grow to love and follow Him.
