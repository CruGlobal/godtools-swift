GodTools Screen shots with Fastlane

In Terminal, from the project root directory, run: "fastlane snapshot"
This will capture the screen shots for all specified devices and languages specified in: godtools-swift/fastlane/Snapfile

When that has completed, in Terminal, go to godtools-swift/fastlane/screenshots, run "fastlane frameit"
This will add frames and captions to the screen shots. Framed screen shots will have 'framed' added to the name. 
Only those images that have title.strings file in the godtools-swift/fastlane/screenshots/<language i.e. en-US> directory will have frames added.
To localize screenshot captions, copy the title.strings file from en_US and add to the language directory and replace strings with localized strings.
